<h1>Deep Learning Bases Traffic Sign Classifier
  In the following project, a novel traffic sign classification method is presented, which aims to address the problem of real time traffic sign classification.<br> 
  Usage of a custom CNN model is proposed to  improve the performance of classification models.
  There are certain disadvantages of the existing systems used for classification, like incorrect predictions, hardware cost and maintenance, which are to a great extent resolved by the proposed system.
